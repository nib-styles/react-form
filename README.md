# @nib-styles/react-form

Styles for `React` based forms at `nib`.

## Installation

    npm install --save @nib-styles/react-form

## Change log

# 0.6.0

- break: bumped version of `@nib-styles/v2-buttons` from `^2.1.1` to `^3.0.1` => it should only be breaking if you depend on it for more than the submit button (a primary button)

# 0.5.0

- add: disabled state for control labels
